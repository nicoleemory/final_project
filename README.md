# Project: AIDSVu Final Project

**Author:** Nicole Hood

**Date:** 10/28/2022

------------------------

# Docker Container
To reproduce this report, you can download the docker image that is available on docker hub at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nicoledocker1/r_proj. To build the container, use "docker build -t r_proj .". Then to run the container, use "docker run -it r_proj bash". Once you are working within the image, use "make report.html" to build the compiled html document for the report that will be saved within the report folder within the final_proj folder.

# Git Repository Organization

`README.md`
- contains info about git repository, dockerfile, and docker image

`data`
- contains all data for the project
-- cities.csv: this contains all HIV-related care continuum data
-- city.csv: this contains data that is available by region
-- city_minus.csv: this contains data that does not include cities that do not 
                   have all data reported

`code/00_clean_data.R`
- loads the city.csv file that contains HIV Care Continuum data for 36 U.S. cities
- the data contains new diagnoses and prevalent diagnoses in total for each city and by demographic characteristics
- selects only data relevant to the table one 
- created objects that sums all cities's remaining data
- created vectors with all the relevant data and put it in a dataframe that can 
  be used to create table 1 and saved as a .rds file in `output/` folder

`code/01_make_table1.R`
- uses the data_clean.rds generate from 00_clean_data.R to create table 1
- the kable extra package was used to create a table 1 with new HIV dx
  and prevalent HIV dx by gender and race
- saves table_one as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder

`code/02_make_plot.R`
- loads the cities.csv and city_minus.csv
- these datasets respectively include city level gender data organized by region
  for each of the 4 HIV Care Continuum steps
- cities and city_minus are the same except city_minus does not contain
  linkage or viral suppression data for Providence, RI or Denver, CO
- creates 4 figures with ggplot geom_point that are saved as .png files 
  in `output/` folder

`code/04_render_report.R`
- renders `report.Rmd`

`makefile`
- this file contains all the rule for building the report
- rather than going into each of the individual R scripts and running them 
- one by one, you can just type "make" and this file will go through its
  rules that will run each script and generate the final report; it will run the 
  docker image, r_proj, which contains a replica of the local computer,
  including the final report
 - to run the report within the Docker container, type "make report.html"
 - to run the report on your local command line, type "make report/report.html"
- it contains rules for building the report.html, the rds files that 
  are used to save the relevant rds data, rds table, and the 4 png figures
- it also removes any .rds and .png and html files after they are used
- if you want to run any of the make rules on their own, you simply have to type "make" and the name of the rule
- it also contains docker-associated rules that allow the report to build within the docker container's image within the report folder


`report.Rmd`
- this is the Rmd that will generate the html final report for the project
- it can be generated by typing "make report.html" in the command line once the user
  is in the relevant directory where the file can be found
- it contains code that is set to not appear in the final report
- it calls all the various relevant .rds and .png files 
- the report contains an introduction describing the data (e.g., HIV Care Continuum
   steps for 36 U.S. cities), a table 1 that shows total number of new HIV diagnoses
   for the 2018 year as well as the prevalent number and then the breakdown by gender and race.
- it also include a description of the table1.
- finally, the report contains a 4 figures and their description. the 4 figures
  are a visual representation of each of the 4 HIV Care Continuum steps by gender 
  within each U.S. region.
